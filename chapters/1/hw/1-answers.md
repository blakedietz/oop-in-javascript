Homework:

Is javascript an interpreted or compiled language?

Interpreted which means it doesn't need to compile and gets read directly

What environments can javascript be executed from?

I am assuming browsers here: Firefox mostly, then chrome and IE; I assume you can use a text editor as well!

Why can it be run in these environments? It can run on these environment because it doesn't need to be compiled down into machine language; in looking at stackexchange, it seems there are two parts to getting javascript to work - the engine and the runtime environment; the engine interprets the language and the runtime environment allows it to work with the outside world;
